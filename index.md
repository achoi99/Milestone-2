## Milestone 2: Definition & Related Work 

### A. Task Problem / Defintion

```Examine and describe your problem of study. Try to describe your problem using terms like properties, affordances, and signifiers. Why is it a problem? How is it theme-relevant? Use the Seven Stages of Action to describe a typical interaction related to your problem. How do you know this interaction is typical?
PROBLEM:
The problem we will be focusing on is how even with the information we are able to receive from Athena many students still face many inconveniences with the location of classes upon the start of the semester. Despite being under the impression that students have successfully completed registration, some information in regards to class location is not even disclosed upfront often resulting in inflexible schedules and difficult commitments.

**Property**: Banner (ATHENA)
 Black, red, white, gray
 Icons, Buttons, Links

**Affordances**:
 Registering for classes
 Browsing Classes
 Preparing for Registration
 Browse Course Catalog
 View Registration Information

**Signifiers**:
 Calendar
 Clipboard
 Magnifier on paper
 Magnifier on notebook (catalog)
 Folder with paper
 Tabs with cursor
 Profile icon

**Description**
- Setting (tools) icon
- Tools bar for other tasks in Banner (AKA Athena)

**Why is it a problem?**
- This is a problem because students will have to sacrifice time in another class to make it to their next class (leaving early or arriving late). Moreover, students will not have a clear understanding of their schedules until after the semester starts.

**How is it theme relevant?**
It is theme relevant because class location plays a crucial role in a student's day by day schedule with in-person instruction. Being able to commute from one class to another is the bare minimum for being able to receive your course material in that class. However, if the student is unable to commute to another class due to the location of that class or the class they previously had before the upcoming class they must attend this force the student into a difficult situation especially if their only choice is through in-person instruction.

**Seven Stages of Action:** 

**Goals**
1.    _Goal (form the goal)_
Registering for classes within a schedule without conflicts.
Execution
2.    _Plan (the action)_
Go to Athena and look up each class or enter CRN?
3.    _Specify (the action sequence)_
Look up each class.
4.    _Perform (the action sequence)_
I will login, click browse classes, Select term registering for, Enter search criteria that has a subject, then search.
Evaluation
5.    _Perceive (the state of the world)_
We are able to see time available, but no location info (at first glance).
6.    _Interpret (the perception)_
I know my classes and that for time they do not overlap.
7.    _Compare (the outcome with the goal)_
Successfully registered for classes, but due to current location schedule conflicts occur.  

**How do you know this interaction is typical?**
https://nsucurrent.nova.edu/2016/10/25/fifteen-minutes-between-classes-isnt-enough/
Aldana Foigel, a student at Nova Southeastern University, stated in the Student-run Newspaper that her college had a 15 minute gap between classes. She argued that it was not enough time because she would always have a tight schedule and her peers would almost always arrive to classes late.

UGA students have trouble with buses during the first week of school. Reported by Red & Black several students have problems navigating getting to class in the allotted time even with buses. Some have even reported walking to class is  preferred, since you are not always guaranteed a spot on the bus. 

**DROP/ADD

**What user population is affected by your problem of study? What related tasks do they perform? How would users benefit from a solution (not necessarily your solution) to your problem of study?**

The user population that is affected by our problem would be students in college or higher education. These students are usually required to register for their classes; then, they are expected to attend class to learn the course material that they will be examined on. Students would benefit from a solution to college commutes because they would not have to sacrifice time from other classes just to get to their next class. They will also have a clear understanding of their class schedule, allowing them to have better management in time.
